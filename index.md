# Development Pipeline Data Inspector Guide

The [Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning (CMAP)](https://www.cmap.illinois.gov/) is currently developing an updated forecast of population and employment for northeastern Illinois through the year 2050. As part of the update, CMAP is using a new land use model called [UrbanSim](https://urbansim.com/urbansim), which simulates real estate development at the parcel level.

To ensure that the model’s results are as accurate as possible, one of the key input datasets is a “development pipeline” of known developments (including any that are currently planned or in progress, as well as any that have been completed since 2010). CMAP has already collected a significant amount of this information in its Northeastern Illinois Development Database, but there are undoubtedly developments that have been missed or for which our information is inaccurate or out of date.

The [Development Pipeline Data Inspector](https://cmapgis.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=c5566f8d5db34d8da9c1cd839ce13d28) web map was created to allow CMAP’s partners to view the information that we currently have, and to help us correct inaccuracies and fill in any gaps in the data so that every community in the region will be accurately represented in the forecasting process.

This website is a guide to using the web map. Please use the links on the left to navigate to the section of interest. There is a link to the web map in the upper-right corner of each page. If you have any questions or feedback about the map or this guide, please reach out to [David Clark (dcclark@cmap.illinois.gov)](mailto:dcclark@cmap.illinois.gov?subject=Development Pipeline Data Inspector).
